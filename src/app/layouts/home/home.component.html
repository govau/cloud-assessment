    <h2>About the framework</h2>
    <span class="traffic-orange">&#33;</span>
    <p>Welcome to the Cloud Assessment Framework (CAF), a tool to help government agencies self-assess whether a particular
      cloud service is suitable for its specific business context, taking into consideration relevant compliance, commercial,
      operability, support and security requirements. The CAF is not a standardised or objective assessment of a cloud vendor
      or service, but rather, a guided self-assessment to help agencies understand what qualities are important to its needs.</p>
    <p>To start a new assessment, simply click Get Started above. You will be asked a series of questions relating to the
      service you are assessing and the context of how you expect to use the service. Some of the questions may require you
      to complete further research before answering. Resources and links are provided alongside the questions to help you
      find the relevant information more quickly.</p>
    <p>When you submit your responses, you will be provided with a tailored assessment report which highlights where your
      responses indicate a potential misalignment between the service and your needs. Additional information will be provided
      to help you understand the results and next steps.</p>
    <p>Note: The questionnaire does not ask you to provide any personal or identifiable details. Other information in the
      questionnaire may be used by the DTA to help them improve and evolve this service.</p>
